        Zagreus: I'm sorry, Dusa, I... put a lot on you, and... maybe I shouldn't have, since I'm the Prince and everything, as you point out, and... sometimes, I forget myself. I'd never pressure you, it's just... I thought you had these feelings for me, too.
        Dusa: I {#DialogueItalicFormat}do {#PreviousFormat}have feelings for you, silly! That's what I've been trying to tell you, it's just... it's just...
        Zagreus: It's just what...? Whatever it is, it's OK. You can be yourself with me, Dusa, I promise.
        Dusa: I'm glad you put it that way. I... I'm not looking for an intimate relationship. You're the kindest soul in this whole House. And I have learned so much from you! But, when I really think about my feelings... I'm just, not attracted to you, in that way. I'm sorry. You're a really nice guy!
        Zagreus: Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, look, there's nothing to apologize for, not at all. In fact... all this is a relief. I've learned a lot from you, too, and I cherish our friendship for what it is. Do you... do you think that we could still be friends? Or, is it better that you didn't see me anymore...?
        Dusa: Don't say {#DialogueItalicFormat}that{#PreviousFormat}! Though, I was going to ask you the same thing. I'd really like it if you'd be my friend! Though, my career comes first, so... I don't want you doing any special favors, promise me? I need to see how far I can get on my own.
        Zagreus: I respect that so much, and yes, I promise, Dusa. So, well, then... friends? For all eternity?

There's all these things she said I need to work on, calmness, not making so many lists, putting things into perspective, not working myself too hard, not taking blame for things that aren't my fault...!

        Dusa: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}, I, but, you... really mean that, huh...? But, you're the Prince himself, and I'm just... look, we both know I am just a floating monster head. And a custodian. I just don't understand. Why keep on being nice to me, like this? I thought you'd never even talk to me...
        Zagreus: You're so much more than what you said. I wish you could see that. If only everybody in this House had your spirit.
        Dusa: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Ah{#PreviousFormat}. If only everybody in this House had yours, Prince Zagreus. You've been so kind to me, and I'm glad we've had a chance to get to know each other more. It's really nice, sometimes... knowing somebody really cares about me here?
        Zagreus: It should be more than sometimes that you feel that way, as far as I'm concerned. I just... I've never met anybody like you before. My father always told me not to smile quite as much, but... you're like me.
        Dusa: What, because I smile, {#DialogueItalicFormat}haha{#PreviousFormat}? Smiling's just a little something that I like to do to deal with the day! Though, oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}that's {#PreviousFormat}what you meant, I... oh, I see. I, look, this is kind of a lot, I, I had better go...! I'll cherish the Ambrosia, though, OK?!

        Persephone: Nyx... of course she was involved. I only managed to escape because of her. Then, she restored my stillborn son to life, and nurtured him? And, I never would have known, unless that child, fully grown and having learned the truth, defied his father, and then found me here?
        Zagreus: Yes. Although, we still don't know how come Father and Nyx never sent for you. Though, {#DialogueItalicFormat}ungh{#PreviousFormat}, let me ask you something, Mother, if you please. If you had found out... that I was born, and very much alive... would you have come back?

        Persephone: All right. We've matters with Olympus to resolve. They don't know I'm here, most of them, besides Zeus, maybe Athena. They think you're Nyx's son rather than mine, and that your goal is still to join them on their mountaintop.
        Zagreus: What a mess. What can we do? The gods of Olympus have all been very good to me, for the most part. I don't feel great about deceiving them. They keep trying to help me escape!
        Persephone: What can we do? We can make peace with them. And let them know the truth. So much of it as they would tolerate. Diplomacy is not your father's strong suit. But I am going to need you two to do exactly as I say. Do you understand?
        Zagreus: Yes, Mother. So what do you intend to do, and how do I fit in?
        Persephone: We're going to invite all of them to a little family gathering! Here. And you shall personally deliver them their invitations, Zagreus.
        Zagreus: Mother, are you serious? So, we're just going to have a bash with them, and they'll just see you after all this time, and be fine with everything?
        Persephone: They certainly shall not be fine with everything. But, Hades and I, we'll be prepared to tell them what they need to hear. Don't worry, I shall do the talking.
        Zagreus: What are you going to say?
        Persephone: Oh, you know! That we met, fell in love, eloped. Had a child. A child who, once grown, sought desperately to reconnect with his extended family. To the chagrin of his grim lord father...
        Zagreus: That's... that's all true. As individual statements, at least.
        Persephone: ...Fortunately, our loving and dutiful son at last persuaded his mother and father to reveal their secretive relationship, and make an effort to rejoin their great family.
        Zagreus: Your mother won't be happy that you left.
        Persephone: I'll deal with her. Perhaps I'll have to visit her and the rest of them from time to time, if that's what it shall take. But I'll be back. I've no choice! Did you know that if you eat the seeds of an Underworld pomegranate, then you cannot leave for one month out of the year, per seed?

I remember how hurt I felt when I found out Father lied to me about you. Now we're lying to Olympus. What if they find out? Even if they don't... I don't like it.
        Persephone: Zagreus... I may not be an expert... but here's what I've come to understand about how families work. At least our own. The thing is... how we speak to one another is even more important than the words we use. I think, deep down, everyone in our family knows this.

        Zagreus: You don't have hard feelings? What about Father? What about Demeter?

        Zagreus: We're fortunate Uncle Zeus seemed to catch on right away, and went along with it. But, this whole elaborate tale you spun... I remember how hurt I felt when I found out Father lied to me about you. Now we're lying to Olympus. What if they find out? Even if they don't... I don't like it.
        Persephone: Zagreus... I may not be an expert... but here's what I've come to understand about how families work. At least our own. The thing is... how we speak to one another is even more important than the words we use. I think, deep down, everyone in our family knows this.
        Zagreus: You're saying they all knew you weren't being perfectly honest, and went along with it anyway? I guess the pomegranate thing in particular was a bit of a stretch.
        Persephone: The common ground in our family is that we want peace. Besides Ares, though even he would rather the conflict occur elsewhere. That elaborate tale... it's less a deception, and more a concession. A way of saying let's move on from the past, and start anew. No hard feelings.
        Zagreus: You don't have hard feelings? What about Father? What about Demeter?
        Persephone: Well, let's see. My hard feelings are nothing next to the joy of having my son in my life. Your father never imagined his relationship with me could be out in the open. And my mother... she's just glad I'm alive.
        Zagreus: And Uncle Zeus is glad things didn't turn out worse for {#DialogueItalicFormat}him{#PreviousFormat}. I get the sense he acts a bit impulsively at times, and deals with the consequences later.
        Persephone: What can I tell you, Zagreus? We're family. You said it yourself to me before: We're stuck with one another. That any of us like each other in the slightest... it's a wonder and a blessing, I think.

        Persephone: Yes, good! Now then... we have a lot of work to go around, so why don't we call everyone on staff, and let them in on this, and dole out suitable responsibilities, all right?
        Hades: All right....
        Zagreus: All right.
        Persephone: All right!
        Persephone: ...{#DialogueItalicFormat}Whew{#PreviousFormat}! I'd say that went about as well as could have been expected! And the cleanup wasn't all that bad. For the most part.

I remember how hurt I felt when I found out Father lied to me about you. Now we're lying to Olympus. What if they find out? Even if they don't... I don't like it.
        Persephone: Zagreus... I may not be an expert... but here's what I've come to understand about how families work. At least our own. The thing is... how we speak to one another is even more important than the words we use. I think, deep down, everyone in our family knows this.
        Zagreus: You're saying they all knew you weren't being perfectly honest, and went along with it anyway? I guess the pomegranate thing in particular was a bit of a stretch.
        Persephone: The common ground in our family is that we want peace. Besides Ares, though even he would rather the conflict occur elsewhere. That elaborate tale... it's less a deception, and more a concession. A way of saying let's move on from the past, and start anew. No hard feelings.

        Zagreus: I thought about it more, Mother, and I would like very much if you and Father were to share this. Though, maybe don't let on where you got it, just in case?
        Persephone: This is splendid, Zagreus, but please! If there's one thing I've learned since we met, it's that the trust we share is at the very foundation of our relationships. Why shouldn't he know who this is from? Besides, I think he could figure it out.
        Zagreus: Well, when it came to the Olympians, you said yourself that there was only so much truth that they could tolerate. Are you sure Father would be tolerant knowing I got this for the both of you?
        Persephone: I'm sure enough! And if he isn't, I suppose it's more for me.
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Haha{#PreviousFormat}, well! Just as long as someone puts it to good use.
        Persephone: ...You know I always wanted to be a mother, Zagreus? But after you were born... I was certain I had lost my chance. Then one fine morning you just walked into my life. And here we are. I still cannot entirely believe it. What I mean is... I love you, Son. I'm doing my best.
        Zagreus: I know. I love you, too, Mother.
